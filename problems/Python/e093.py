''' By using each of the digits from the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, exactly once, and
making use of the four arithmetic operations (+, âˆ’, *, /) and
brackets/parentheses, it is possible to form different positive integer
targets. Note that concatenations of the digits are not allowed. Find the set
of four distinct digits, a < b < c < d, for which the longest set of
consecutive positive integers, 1 to n, can be obtained, giving your answer as
