''' A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define
R(k) to be a repunit of length k. Given that n is a positive integer and
GCD(n, 10) = 1, it can be shown that there always exists a value, k, for which
R(k) is divisible by n, and let A(n) be the least such value of k. You are
given that for all primes, p > 5, that p âˆ’ 1 is divisible by A(p). Find the
sum of the first twenty-five composite values of n for which GCD(n, 10) = 1 and
n âˆ’ 1 is divisible by A(n). '''
