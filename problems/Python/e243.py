''' A positive fraction whose numerator is less than its denominator is called
a proper fraction.  For any denominator, d, there will be dâˆ’1 proper fractions.
We shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a resilient fraction.
Furthermore we shall define the resilience of a denominator, R(d), to be the
ratio of its proper fractions that are resilient. Find the smallest denominator
d, having a resilience R(d) < 15499/94744 '''
