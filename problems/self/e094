We shall define an almost equilateral triangle to be a triangle for which two
sides are equal and the third differs by no more than one unit. Find the sum
of the perimeters of all almost equilateral triangles with integral side
lengths and area and whose perimeters do not exceed one billion.

This is reducible to two Diophantine equations:
    3*x^2 - 4*y^2 + 2*x - 1 = 0
    3*x^2 - 4*y^2 - 2*x + 1 = 0

We only care about the value of x because it represents the lengths of the
sides that are equal. Depending on the equation used, the perimeter is simply
this figure tripled plus or minus one. General solutions were found with sympy

Valid values of x for the first equation (third side is one less):
17, 241, 3361, 46817, 652081, 9082321, 126500417

Valid values of x for the second equation (third side is one more):
5, 65, 901, 12545, 174725, 2433601, 33895685

The resulting total is 518408346
