In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers. 1/x + 1/y =
1/n. What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct solutions
exceeds four million?

The number of distinct solutions to this equation for some given 'n' is equal
to (d(n^2) + 1) / 2, where d() is the number of divisors function. The 1 is
added because when d() is evaluated for a perfect square, it produces an odd
number. For a given number 'x' with a prime factorization of
p1^e1*p2^e2*p3^e3... the number of divisors is (e1+1)*(e2+1)*(e3+1)...
Because we are considering 'n**2', if the prime factorization of 'n' is known
we simply multiply each exponent by 2 in the above equation.

The upper bound on the solution to this particular problem is found by
simply considering the case where successive primes, starting with 2, are
multiplied. Eventually the total number of divisors will exceed 4,000,000. As
it turns out, only the first 15 primes need to be considered to establish an
upper bound. This is because each additional prime results in multiplying by 3
and (3**15 + 1) / 2 > 4,000,000.

The first 15 primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47

| 2     | 3   | 7    |
| 3     | 3   | 7    |
| 5     | 2   | 5    |
| 7     | 2   | 5    |
| 11    | 1   | 3    |
| 13    | 1   | 3    |

| 23    | 1   | 3    |
| 29    | 1   | 3    |
| 31    | 1   | 3    |
| 37    | 1   | 3    |

In order to get rid of the larger primes, the lowest primes must be raised to a
higher exponent to account for the loss. For example, 47 can be discarded if 2
is raised to the 3rd power - a worthwhile tradeoff in terms of minimizing the
product. 43 can then be discarded by raising 3 to the 3rd power. 41 can be
discarded by raising 5 and 7 to the 2nd power. At this point it is no longer
worth it to remove numbers. The number that results from multiplying these
primes with their associated exponents together is 9350130049860600.
