For some positive integers k, there exists an integer partition of the form
4^t = 2^t + k, where 4^t, 2^t, and k are all positive integers and t is a
real number.  The first two such partitions are 4^1 = 2^1 + 2 and
4^1.5849625... = 2^1.5849625... + 6. Partitions where t is also an integer
are called perfect. For any m ≥ 1 let P(m) be the proportion of such
partitions that are perfect with k ≤ m

The general formula for 'k' is n^2-n for any n > 1 (from here on called
'valid'). The general formula for 'k' with integer 't' is 2^n*(2^n-1) (from
here on called 'integer'). If all 'integer' and 'valid' solutions are generated
up to some endpoint so that the ratio of 'integer' to 'valid' is less than
'target' (1 / 12345) then a binary search can be performed to find the index
where the ratio first falls below 'target' (I did this manually)

The value at this index is the answer:
    44043947822
