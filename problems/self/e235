Given is the arithmetic-geometric sequence u(k) = (900-3k)r^(k-1). Let s(n) =
Î£u(k) for k = 1 to n. Find the value of r for which s(5000) = -600,000,000,000.
Give your answer rounded to 12 places behind the decimal point.

This is reducible to solving the equation:
    (-14100r^5001 + 14103r^5000 - 900r + 897) / (r-1)^2 = -6*10^11
Simple trial and error (effectively simulating a binary search) yields the
result: 1.002322108633
