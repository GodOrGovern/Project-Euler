A positive fraction whose numerator is less than its denominator is called
a proper fraction.  For any denominator, d, there will be dâˆ’1 proper fractions.
We shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a resilient fraction.
Furthermore we shall define the resilience of a denominator, R(d), to be the
ratio of its proper fractions that are resilient. Find the smallest denominator
d, having a resilience R(d) < 15499/94744

For a given denominator d, R(d) is simply phi(d) / (d - 1), where phi() is
Euler's totient function. As explored in e069, phi() is minimized when
successive primes are multiplied together. Multiplying the primes from 2 to 23
puts us about 0.000000005 above the desired limit. It is, however, unnecessary
to multiply this by 29. One can instead simply raise 2 to the 3rd power,
yielding a product of 892371480.
